/**
 * Solid door object that blocks passage until opened by external logic.
 * Characteristics:
 * - Type: {@code TYPE_OBSTACLE} (collidable).
 * - Hitbox: occupies the lower portion of the tile (x=0, y=16, w=48, h=32).
 * - Visual: {@code /objects/door_normal}.
 * - Interaction: shows a hint that a key is required; this class does not perform unlocking itselfâ€”actual unlocking (e.g., consuming a key and replacing/removing the door) is handled elsewhere.
